# SellerInfo

A simple add-on for the Firefox browser that displays the location of a seller on Amazon.de. If the information is available then the country and its flag will be displayed directly on the product page. Thus allowing you to actually see where a product might be shipped from. 

### Limitations

Currently this addon will only work on the German Amazon.de site.
